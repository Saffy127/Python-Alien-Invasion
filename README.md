# Alien Invasion

Alien Invasion is a Python game inspired by the classic arcade game Space Invaders. The player controls a spaceship that can move left and right at the bottom of the screen and shoot bullets at the aliens that descend from the top of the screen. The player must avoid being hit by the aliens or their lasers, and destroy all the aliens before they reach the bottom of the screen. The game becomes more challenging as the player progresses to higher levels, where the aliens move faster and more frequently.

## Installation

To run Alien Invasion, you need to have Python 3 and Pygame installed on your computer. You can download Python 3 from https://www.python.org/downloads/ and Pygame from https://www.pygame.org/download.shtml.

To install Alien Invasion, clone this repository or download the zip file and extract it. Then, navigate to the project folder and run the alien_invasion.py file:

`python alien_invasion.py`

## How to play

Use the left and right arrow keys to move your spaceship horizontally. Press the spacebar to shoot bullets. Press Q to quit the game.

You start with three lives. Each time you are hit by an alien or a laser, you lose one life and your spaceship is reset to the center of the screen. The game is over when you run out of lives or when an alien reaches the bottom of the screen.

You score points for each alien you destroy. The score is displayed at the top right corner of the screen. The level is displayed at the top left corner of the screen. You advance to the next level when you clear all the aliens on the screen. The aliens will move faster and more often as you progress to higher levels.
